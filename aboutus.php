		<h2>Who Are We?</h2>
		<br /><br />
		<p class="paragraph-body">
			The Appleseed Collective  is a non-profit working group of Transition Guelph, whose volunteers harvest area vegetables, fruits and nuts, and share the bounty with Guelph soup kitchens and food banks.
			<br /><br />
			Appleseed Collective Revival is a social enterprise that takes (pesticide-free) volunteer donations and blemished fruit, and transforms them into pure fruit sauces, made with love in a local health-inspected kitchen.
			<br /><br />
			These products are then sold within the community to support the Collectiveâ€™s ongoing efforts, including the stewardship of a local orchard placed in our care, and the engagement of community youth in volunteer projects.
